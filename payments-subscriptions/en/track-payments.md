## Track Payment Notifications {#track-payments}

The receipt of various payments can be recorded in the Payments tab of the Payments menu.

If receiving payments through PayPal, the payment details will automatically be recorded here. The account administrator for your PayPal account will also receive notification of payment. 

Publication fees will also be recorded here once they have been marked as paid or waived by an editor.

> Manual subscription payments will **not** be recorded. To track the status of manual subscription payments, use the Status and Notes fields of your subscriptions.
