# Learning OJS 3.5 for Site Administrators

Open Journal Systems (OJS) is an open source solution to managing and publishing scholarly journals online. OJS is a highly flexible editor-operated journal management and publishing system that can be downloaded for free and installed on a local Web server.

The Site Administrator role in OJS is created as part of the OJS installation process performed by a system administrator. This guide covers the tasks performed by this role, including: creating, editing and deleting journals from the installation; managing users and bulk email settings for each journal on the installation; enabling the languages and plugins available to journals on the installation; and performing basic site maintenance tasks.
