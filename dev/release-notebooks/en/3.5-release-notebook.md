{:.notice}

OJS, OMP and OPS version 3.5 were released on **RELEASE DATE HERE**. This release notebook provides technical guidance on changes that will impact software developers, plugin and theme authors, and anyone who works with the application codebase.

## Long-Term Support (LTS) and Short-Term Support (STS)

PKP alternates between releases of Long-Term Support (LTS) and Short-Term Support (STS) for major releases of OJS, OMP, and OPS.

OJS, OMP, and OPS 3.5.0 will become PKP's next Long-Term Support (LTS) releases **when, but not until, the LTS designation is added to 3.5.0 on the download page**. This indicates to the community that these releases will be kept reliable, stable, and predictable for a period of 3 to 5 years.

When the LTS designation is added to 3.5.0, **users can expect to have 12 months to plan and execute the upgrade from 3.3.0 LTS to 3.5.0 LTS**. After one year, 3.3.0 will reach end-of-life and **will no longer be maintained** for security or reliability.

## Hosting and Deployment

### Configuration File Changes

Changes to the configuration file are documented in the [release notes](https://github.com/pkp/ojs/blob/stable-3_5_0/docs/release-notes/README-3.5.0).

A new setting in `[general]` called `app_key` will be generated and added during the upgrade process.

There are several new options and some settings have been removed. All new settings have sensible defaults; no manual intervention is required in the configuration file when upgrading.

### Hosting Environment

OJS/OMP/OPS 3.5.0 require at least PHP 8.2.0.

## Code Changes

### Eloquent Migrations

PKP is gradually adopting Laravel's [Eloquent ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/eloquent) and [Query Builder](https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/queries) as its preferred approach to database interactions. Over time we will replace legacy DAO classes with newer patterns using these tools. In 3.5.0, the following entities have been refactored to use an Eloquent model:

- [Announcements](https://github.com/pkp/pkp-lib/blob/stable-3_5_0/classes/announcement/Announcement.php)
- [Controlled Vocabularies](https://github.com/pkp/pkp-lib/blob/stable-3_5_0/classes/controlledVocab/ControlledVocab.php) (and related entities, including [User Interests](https://github.com/pkp/pkp-lib/blob/stable-3_5_0/classes/user/interest/UserInterest.php))
- [Email Logs](https://github.com/pkp/pkp-lib/blob/stable-3_5_0/classes/log/EmailLogEntry.php)
- [Notes](https://github.com/pkp/pkp-lib/blob/stable-3_5_0/classes/note/Note.php)
- [Notifications](https://github.com/pkp/pkp-lib/blob/stable-3_5_0/classes/notification/Notification.php)
- [Publication Categories](https://github.com/pkp/pkp-lib/blob/stable-3_5_0/classes/publication/PublicationCategory.php)
- [Queries / Discussions](https://github.com/pkp/pkp-lib/blob/stable-3_5_0/classes/query/Query.php)
- [Stage Assignments](https://github.com/pkp/pkp-lib/blob/stable-3_5_0/classes/stageAssignment/StageAssignment.php)
- [User Groups](https://github.com/pkp/pkp-lib/blob/stable-3_5_0/classes/userGroup/UserGroup.php)

Code that used the previous DAO-based implementations, including related hooks, will need to be refactored.

#### Review Assignments

Review assignments were refactored from the deprecated DAO pattern to the Repository / `EntityDAO` pattern. To get a review assignment by ID use:
```php
$reviewAssignment = Repo::reviewAssignments()->get($id)
```
ReviewAssignmentDAO was removed and attempts to use it will cause an error.

## REST API Changes

The following major changes have been made to the REST API:

- The backend submissions handler (`_submissions`) was extended to support refactored submission listings and review assignments.

See all the changes in [3.5 API Reference](/dev/api/ojs/3.5.html)
